            <h1>Joker</h1>
            <p>The Joker is villain who operaates in Gotham City. He is a homicidal artist and an agent of chaos,
                he is the embodiment of everything Batman fights against. The Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind.
                Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor  whose real name and 
                identity is completely unkown, is characterised by his chalk-white skin and green hair. The clown finds
                humour in suffering of others.</p>

            <h1>About</h1>
       <h1>Why is the Joker the most loved Villain</h1> 
       Why do people love the Joker? Because he is incorruptible. He has his own code and nothing can change his mind. 
       He is a man of action that wants to bring change to this world based on his code.Most villains are motivated by
        greed (for power or money) or revenge. <br>
        Joker’s view of the world is more realistic than that of Batman’s. Everything Joker says make more sense in the current world.For example when he tells Batman
        "To them, you're just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out, 
        like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only 
        as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other.
         See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve." <br>
         Joker is a story of a common person who has suffered a lot in life who is having the attitude of survival
         having some relevance to society issues We all have the darkness in ourselves but we never tend to show because of social norms.
         We are a kind of escapist people who never face real sitation. <br>If I talk about joker his medication stopped due to society issues ,
         government do not support him with his medication because they stopped funds to his mental care clinic.
         First of all he is suffering from mental illnes he needs a special attention and medication.
         But as a society we are not giving him a special care or attention we are abandoning him as a normal person. <br>       
         He also got bullied by a Wall Street traders.     
        He also tried to show that he is suffering from mental illness that he can laugh at very opposite situatiion.
         I am not justifying his behaviour that he killed people.
         But as a society whatever he has done we have also made him to do that.
         He has also suffered betrayal from his mother and father.
         I relate with joker but I cannot justify his killings.
         But he has charming personality. He also trieS to be and stand up comedian but from his upbringing he never found normal funny situation
         We are also suffering from identity crisis.
         We all have our own reasons to love that character.
